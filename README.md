Our College Application Tracker Database System will serve as a web application designed for students to efficiently manage their college application process. The system allows users to track their applications, deadlines, and statuses while providing features like task management and document storage. The purpose of our system is to provide students with a centralized area to meet their deadlines and goals and track everything related to college applications, ensuring everything is easily accessible in one single place.

Users will be able to create an account, log in securely, manage individual colleges to apply to with customization for each college (average GPA, year founded, location, etc), tasks with deadlines, and overall, have a centralized location to streamline the process. With features like task managemen and real-time progress tracking, we aimed to create a system that keeps students organized while on top of deadlines.
